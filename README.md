# arabic-notes
Version 1.0
5/21/25

Before I start anything, my current goal for this project is to basically
have flash cards for what I've learned. Essentially, it's Anki or like
Quizlet, but I wanted to get a good feel of how to develop something like
those on my own. 

I'm thinking standard arabic, but when I get through that start shifting to Egytian arabic, maybe a note saying "oh well, this card is currently still standard arabic".

What I want to include : 
- Each page is it's own word, like a notecard
- It's shuffled, so when you press next, it's never the same next card
- Audio included (not mine)
- Depending on words, include image as well
- A master list / home screen that has all the words there, maybe by them
